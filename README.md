Dewdrop UI
==========

This is the beginning of a project to develop a useful and elegant UI
framework for web applications.

Unlike some UI frameworks that seek to replace HTML with Javascript API
calls, Dewdrop is designed around idiomatic HTML and CSS. Javascript will
be used to enhance the UI, but not to define it. Dewdrop will degrade
gracefully, so that even if you turn off Javascript and CSS, you will
still be able to use the underlying web application.

At least, that's what Dewdrop will be eventually. Currently it's in the
earliest stages of development, and is not usable by any standard.
